    "3. Complexity: Searching can have different levels of complexity depending on the data structure and the algorithm used.\n",
    "4. Deterministic vs Non-deterministic: Some searching algorithms, like binary search, are deterministic, meaning they follow a clear and systematic approach. Others, such as linear search, are non-deterministic, as they may need to examine the entire search space in the worst case."
